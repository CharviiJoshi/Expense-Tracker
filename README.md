Smart Expense Tracker
📌 Project Overview
This is a Python-based expense tracking application designed to help users log, categorize, and monitor their monthly expenses efficiently. The app allows users to input their expenses, saves them to a file, and provides a summary to help them stay within their budget.

🎯 Features
✅ Log Expenses – Enter expense name, category, and amount via the terminal.
✅ File Storage – Automatically saves all expenses to a CSV file.
✅ Expense Summary – Reads the file and calculates total expenses for the month.
✅ Budget Tracking – Displays remaining balance based on a predefined monthly budget.

✨ Additional Features
🚀 Category-wise Expense Breakdown – View spending per category.
🚀 Daily Budget Estimate – Suggests how much can be spent per day to stay within budget.

📁 Project Structure
The application consists of two main files:

📌 expense.py – Defines the Expense class for managing expense entries.
📌 expense_tracker.py – Contains the main logic for recording, storing, and summarizing expenses.

1️⃣ The user enters an expense name, category, and amount.
2️⃣ The app saves the expense to a CSV file.
3️⃣ The app reads the file to calculate total expenses.
4️⃣ The user gets an updated balance and a category-wise breakdown.
